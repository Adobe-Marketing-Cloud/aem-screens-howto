AccuWeather API integration
================================

Use Case
--------
Acme Corp is a multinational fast-food franchise. The company delivers content which is personalized based on the current weather in each location: if the weather is sunny, it might promote ice creams while when it is rainy or cold, it might promote hot coffee.

This how-to project walks you through how to achieve personalized content based on weather (provided by [www.accuweather.com](https://www.accuweather.com)).

The project leverages AEM [personalization](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/administering/using/personalization.html) which includes the [ContextHub](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/administering/using/contexthub-config.html), the [Segmentation engine](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/administering/using/segmentation.html) and the [Content Targeting UI](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/authoring/using/content-targeting-touch.html).

**Warning**: the project requires an apikey to connect to Accuweather APIs. The placeholder must be replaced by your own key for demo usage of the code. You can edit the apikey in the [AccuWeather store config](http://localhost:4502/etc/cloudsettings/screens-howto/contexthub/accuweather.edit.html) or directly in the [.content.xml file](src/main/content/jcr_root/etc/cloudsettings/screens-howto/contexthub/accuweather/.content.xml#L9)

How to Use the Sample Content
-----------------------------

- [Video recording](https://adobe.ly/2Jy9MZJ) showcasing the use case
- Open the [channel with content based on weather](http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/screens/screens-howto/channels/data-trigger-accuweather/channel.edit.html)
- Switch to _Targeting_ mode
- Select _Screens HowTo_ brand and _Weather Based Campaign_ activity and hit the _Start Targeting_ button
- Explore the different content variations by switch the different _Audiences_
- Content can be edited per variation
- Switch then to _Preview_ mode
- Expand the _ContextHub_ which shows the current weather information: content displayed in the channel is the content defined for the current weather. For now, no simulation is possible and location is hardcoded to be Basel.

Technical Details
-----------------

### Compatibility

AEM version|Compatibility     |Comments
-----------|------------------|--------
6.3        |:white_check_mark:|
6.4        |:heavy_exclamation_mark:|While weather based content should be working, some bugs have been raised regarding segments authoring and ContextHub administration.

### Features built upon

The solution uses:
- the [ContextHub](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/developing/using/contexthub.html)
- the [Segmentation engine](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/administering/using/segmentation.html)
- the [Content Targeting UI](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/authoring/using/ch-previewing.html#UIModuleFeatures)
- a standard Sequence Channel

### Manual installation

This module requires HowTo project and is part of the install process. Follow [instructions here](../../README.md).

If you still want to install the module individually, you can run:

```
mvn clean install content-package:install
```

### Manual content setup

Start by familiarizing yourself with the concept of [Personalization](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/administering/user-guide.html?topic=/experience-manager/6-4/sites/administering/morehelp/personalization.ug.js) and [Authoring Targeted Content Using Targeting Mode
](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/authoring/using/content-targeting-touch.html) for Sites.

Note that we won't be describing how to create the custom _ContextHub Store_ and its _Content Targeting UI_, nor the _Personalization Segments_ and _Personalization Audiences_ setup as the steps will vary in the various AEM versions and links to the documentation have been provided above in the [Features built upon](#features-built-upon) section.

0. [Edit the channel](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/authoring/using/managing-channels.html#WorkingwithChannels) and add assets or components as needed.
0. Edit the channel properties and click the _Personalization_ tab
    - set _ContextHub Path_ to `/etc/cloudsettings/screens-howto/contexthub`
    - set _Segments Path_ to `/etc/segmentation/contexthub/screens-howto`
0. Click _Save & Close_ to save your changes
0. Edit the channel content and switch to _Targeting_ mode
0. Select _Screens HowTo_ brand and _Weather Based Campaign_ activity and hit the _Start Targeting_ button
0. Select the component for which you want to have targeted content
0. Click the _Target_ button to enable targeting for that component
0. Define the content for each variation (default, `Rainy or cloudy` weather and `Sunny` weather) by selecting the variation in the _Audiences_ in the side rail and adjusting the content as needed
0. Switch then to _Preview_ mode
0. Expand the _ContextHub_ which shows the current ASCII information (if not visible).
0. The content will adjust depending on the weather in Basel
    - For now, no simulation is possible
